# Todoly

A list based todolist web app, heavily inspired from https://github.com/manuelernestog/weektodo but with a focus on:
- Centralized self-hosted server
- Offline / sync
- Cross-platform
- Alarms & notifications
- Archives
- Multi-users
- Workspaces
- Widgets
- Locales

### Stack

This application is also a way to properly test my new stack:

- Next.js (v12 ftm)
- Chakra UI
- tRPC
- Prisma (+ prisma-zod-generator)
- Storybook
